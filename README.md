Software Developer with a background in QA/Testing. I primarily work in JavaScript.

I currently work at magneticNorth, a Manchester based digital agency, where I have helped to solve some really cool problems for some cool organisations, such creating [a dashboard to explore and visualise the complete history of the British film industry](https://filmography.bfi.org.uk) for the BFI, and creating a prototype audio-only game for visually impaired people for the BBC.

I love solving problems, I love understanding how systems work, and I love making things - not just coding, I also make music and wooden spoons in my spare time. I really want to make a clock too. 

I want to work in a company which has similar commitments to me. I care about craftsmanship, and I want to work with developers who will challenge me and facilitate my learning. If your company wants to make a positive impact on society, that's a bonus too.

Skills
---

Here is a non-exhaustive list of technologies I have used professionally, listed alphabetically.

`Amazon Alexa` `AngularJS` `AWS` `Babel` `Bespoken SDK` `Bootstrap` `Codeception` `d3` `Expo` `Express` `Git` `Gulp` `Grunt` `JavaScript` `Jest` `jQuery` `Laravel` `Mocha` `MongoDB` `MySQL` `Node` `PhantomJS` `PHP` `PHPUnit` `Python` `React` `React Native` `Redux` `Resonance Audio` `RSpec` `Ruby` `socket.io` `Vagrant` `Web Audio` `Webpack` `Wordpress` 

#### Quick Learner :running_man:
I learned to code in 12 weeks at Makers Academy. At magneticNorth I have worked on a wide variety of projects that have involved completely new technologies to me, such as React, Redux, d3, web-audio, and always picked them up and contributed towards a high-quality product. I am confident in my abilities and getting stuck doesnâ€™t phase me. I love a challenge.

#### Analytic :thinking::thinking::thinking:
My undergrad and postgrad studies in Mathematics and Philosophy have shaped the way I think and given me a strong ability to break problems down and to understand and use complex ideas. 

#### Testing :white_check_mark::white_check_mark::x:
I spent almost 2 years working as a QA Analyst, manually writing and executing feature and regression tests on a monolithic system. This has given me a real commitment to TDD, and also means I'm quite good at it.

#### Teaching :books: :man_teacher:
I love sharing my knowledge. I really love pair-programming. I'm a regular tutor at [codebar](http://codebar.io), and in the coming months will be teaching at [CodeFirst:Girls](http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/) and at [MCR Codes dev bootcamp](https://mcr.codes/)

Projects (that I can show you)
---
#### [BFI Filmography](https://filmography.bfi.org.uk)
I worked in a team of three developers that created a dashboard to allow users to explore and share the BFI's complete filomgraphy.
The project uses React/Redux and d3 on the front end, and is powered by an Express/Mongo API. The contributions I'm most proud of are working to make the library of chart components as reusable and customizable as possible. This was my first major project at magneticNorth and I learned a tonne of things and it's probably the coolest thing I'll ever work on.

#### [Guitar Tuner Alexa Skill](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Michael-Harrison-Guitar-Tuner/dp/B0768Z8LY9/)
Amazon Alexa skill to help you tune your guitar. Won me a pair of socks.

#### [flash-redux](https://github.com/harrim91/flash-redux)
Redux middleware, actions and reducer for managing flash messages. It's not ground breaking but I wanted to make an open-source NPM package and I think it's well written.

#### [Happy Belly](https://www.github.com/harrim91/allergy_scanner_frontend)
Makers Academy final project. Mobile app that allows the user to select a diet profile (e.g. nut allergy, lactose intolerance), and then scan the barcode on a food product to see if they can eat it.

Built in less than two weeks using Ionic/Angular. The app has a [decoupled rails-api backend](http://www.github.com/harrim91/allergy_scanner_backend)
